Error calling OpenAI API with error message: Rate limit reached for gpt-4-turbo-preview in organization org-lcXnPJjLDvvmGUrczUykSy85 on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 30000, Used 26515, Requested 6774. Please try again in 6.578s. Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits to learn more.
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 2}
Reason: The search results for "file manager" are displayed, but none of the listed results are clickable, which suggests that these might not be actual apps but possibly search suggestions or non-functional placeholders. To proceed, it would be best to clear the current search and attempt a different approach to locate and open the file manager.
Summary: Cleared the search box by clicking the 'X' button to reset the search and attempt a new approach to find and open the file manager, as previous results were non-functional.
Completed step 6.

Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "file manager"}
Reason: Since the previous attempts to find the file manager by scrolling and searching directly in the app drawer were unsuccessful, I will now use the "open_app" action to directly open the file manager. This approach bypasses the need to visually locate the app icon in the app drawer.

Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "file manager"}
Reason: Since the previous attempts to find the file manager through the app drawer were unsuccessful, and the search within the app drawer did not yield the desired result, it's more efficient to directly open the file manager using the "open_app" action. This action will directly open the file manager if it is installed on the device.

Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "file manager", "index": 1}
Reason: After clearing the search box, the next step is to re-enter the search term "file manager" to attempt locating and opening the file manager app again. This is necessary because the previous search did not successfully reveal the app, and a fresh search might yield better results.
Summary: Entered "file manager" into the search box to locate and open the file manager app; search results are visible but none are clickable, indicating a potential issue with the search function or app visibility.

Action: {"action_type": "navigate_home"}
Reason: The search results for "file manager" are displayed, but none of the results are clickable, indicating that they may not be actual apps or the correct apps to open. Since the search within the app drawer has not been successful in finding a functional file manager app, the next step is to try a different approach to access the file manager. A common alternative is to navigate back to the home screen and attempt to open the file manager directly using the "open_app" action, which can directly open an app if it is installed on the device.
Summary: Navigated to the home screen as the search results for "file manager" were not actionable; next step is to try opening the file manager directly.

Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "file manager"}
Reason: After navigating to the home screen, the next step is to open the file manager directly. Since the previous attempts to find and open the file manager through the app drawer were unsuccessful, using the "open_app" action to directly open the file manager is the most straightforward approach.

Reason: After navigating back to the home screen, the next step is to attempt opening the file manager app directly using the `open_app` action, as previous attempts to locate and open it through the app drawer were unsuccessful.

Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "file manager"}
Reason: After navigating back to the home screen, the next step is to open the file manager directly using the `open_app` action, as previous attempts to locate and open it through the app drawer were unsuccessful.

Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "file manager"}
Reason: After navigating back to the home screen, the next step is to open the file manager directly using the "open_app" action, as previous attempts to locate and open it through the app drawer were unsuccessful.

Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "file manager"}
Reason: After navigating back to the home screen, the next step is to open the file manager directly using the "open_app" action, as previous attempts to locate and open it through the app drawer were unsuccessful.

----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_home"}
Reason: The current screen shows a keyboard, which indicates that the phone is possibly in a text input mode. To proceed with the user's request to open a file in the file manager, we need to exit this keyboard view and return to the home screen to access the file manager app.
Summary: Navigated to the home screen to exit the keyboard view and access the file manager; the action was intended to clear the current text input mode.
Completed step 1.

Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 50}
Reason: The current screen shows the keyboard, which indicates that the phone is still in a text input mode. To proceed with the task of opening the file manager and accessing the file, it's necessary to exit this mode. The most straightforward way to do this is by pressing the "back" button to close the keyboard.
Summary: Attempted to close the keyboard by clicking the "Enter" key (index 50), but the keyboard remains open. Next step should be to use the "Back" button to exit text input mode.

Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The keyboard is still open, and the previous attempt to close it by pressing the "Enter" key was unsuccessful. To proceed with navigating the phone and accessing the file manager, the keyboard needs to be closed. The "Back" button (index 6) is a reliable method to exit the keyboard view.
Summary: Clicked the "Back" button to close the keyboard, successfully returning to the home screen with app icons visible, ready for further navigation.
Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The user's goal is to open the file "task.html" in Downloads using the file manager and then open it with Chrome. To achieve this, we first need to access the file manager. Since the file manager app is not directly visible on the home screen, we will open the app drawer to locate and open the file manager.

Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The user's goal is to open the file "task.html" in Downloads using the file manager and then open it with Chrome. Currently, the app drawer is open, displaying various apps. To proceed, I need to locate and open the file manager app. Since the file manager app is not visible on the current screen, I will scroll down to reveal more apps.
E0000 00:00:1753062673.027868  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long

Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: The file manager app is not visible on the current screen, and previous attempts to locate it by scrolling through the app drawer were unsuccessful. To proceed with the task of opening the file "task.html" in Downloads, I will use the "open_app" action to directly open the file manager, assuming it is installed on the device.
Summary: Opened the "Files" app successfully, navigating directly to the Downloads folder where "task.html" is visible but not clickable. Next, need to find a way to interact with the file to open it in Chrome.
Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "long_press", "index": 14}
Reason: The file "task.html" is visible on the screen but is not clickable. To proceed with opening the file, I will attempt to long press on the file name, which might bring up additional options for opening the file.

Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 4}
Reason: The file "task.html" is currently selected, and the next step is to open it. Since the file is already selected and the UI does not show any direct option to open the file, the "More options" button (index 4) is likely to provide further actions such as opening the file with a specific application like Chrome.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The user's goal is to open the file "task.html" in Chrome. Currently, the screen shows the app selection interface with Chrome and HTML Viewer as options. However, Chrome is not clickable at the moment. To proceed, I will scroll down to potentially reveal more of the screen or make the Chrome option clickable.

Reason: The user's goal is to open the file "task.html" in Chrome. The previous actions have successfully navigated to the screen where Chrome can be selected to open the file. The next logical step is to click on Chrome to proceed with opening the file.
Summary: Clicked on an element to proceed with opening "task.html" in Chrome, but the action did not result in any visible change or progress towards opening the file. The target element might have been incorrect or unresponsive. Need to reassess and possibly select a different actionable element.
Completed step 13.
----------step 14
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 5}
Reason: The previous attempts to open "task.html" with Chrome were unsuccessful, possibly due to incorrect element selection. The current screen shows the file "task.html" and the option to open it with an application. To proceed, I will attempt to click on the Chrome option again, which should now be visible and clickable to open the file.

Since the previous clicks on index 5 were not successful and it is marked as non-clickable, I will try clicking on another element that might represent the Chrome option.

Action: {"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}
Reason: The previous attempts to open "task.html" with Chrome have been unsuccessful, and the current screen does not show any actionable elements that would allow for opening the file with Chrome. The options visible are not related to opening files but are rather general file management options. Given the repeated unsuccessful attempts and the lack of visible options to proceed with opening the file in Chrome, it seems appropriate to conclude that the task cannot be completed with the current available actions and screen state.
Agent stopped since it thinks mission impossible.
Completed step 20.
Agent indicates task is done.
Task Failed ❌;  Open the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome. Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.

----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_home"}
Reason: To begin the task of opening the file "task.html" in Downloads, we first need to access the file manager on the Android device. Since the file manager app is not directly visible on the current home screen, we will open the app drawer to locate and open the file manager.
E0000 00:00:1753063063.174090  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long
Summary: Navigated to the home screen to access the app drawer for locating the file manager, as it was not directly visible on the initial screen. The action was successful, and the home screen is now displayed, ready for the next step to open the app drawer.

Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 0}
Reason: The user's goal is to open the file "task.html" in Downloads using the file manager and then open it with Chrome. Currently, the file manager app is not visible on the home screen. To proceed, I need to access the app drawer where additional apps, including the file manager, might be located.
Summary: Attempted to access the app drawer by clicking on the screen, but the action did not change the screen state, indicating the click may have been ineffective or misdirected. Need to reassess the approach to open the app drawer.

Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 11}
Reason: The user's goal is to open the file "task.html" in Downloads using the file manager and then use Chrome to view it. Since the file manager app is not directly visible on the home screen, the next step is to open the app drawer to locate the file manager. The previous attempt to open the app drawer by clicking index 0 was ineffective. Observing the current screenshot, the Google app icon at index 11 is typically associated with a search or app suggestion functionality on Android devices, which might help in locating or opening the file manager directly.
E0000 00:00:1753063100.136220  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long
Summary: Clicked on the Google app icon (index 11) to access search or app suggestion functionality, aiming to locate the file manager.

Reason: The next step in the user's goal is to open the file "task.html" located in the Downloads folder. The file is visible on the screen, but it is not clickable according to the UI element details. To proceed, I will attempt to long press the file, which might trigger a context menu or another method to open the file.
Summary: Long-pressed "task.html" to trigger selection; file is now selected, indicating potential next steps to open or manage the file.
Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 4}
Reason: The file "task.html" is currently selected, and the next step is to open it.

E0000 00:00:1753063699.449377  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long
Summary: Clicked on the Google Lens icon (index 13) intending to open the Camera app, but mistakenly opened Google Lens instead. Need to navigate back and open the correct Camera app to take a photo.
Completed step 1.
----------step 2
E0000 00:00:1753063705.796001  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: Since the goal is to take a photo and the current screen is Google Lens, which was opened mistakenly, the appropriate action is to navigate back to the main screen or camera app to access the camera functionality directly.
E0000 00:00:1753063712.495821  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long
Summary: Navigated back from Google Lens to the home screen successfully, aligning with the goal to access the camera app directly for taking a photo. Next, should open the camera app to proceed with the goal.
Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 13}
Reason: The user's goal is to take a photo. The Camera app icon is visible on the home screen, labeled with index 13. To proceed with the goal, I will click on the Camera app icon to open it.

Summary: Clicked on index 13 intending to open the Camera app to take a photo, but mistakenly opened Google Lens instead. Need to navigate back and correctly open the Camera app.
Completed step 3.
----------step 4
E0000 00:00:1753063756.579862  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The user's goal is to take a photo, and currently, the Google Lens app is open, which is not suitable for this task. The previous attempts to open the Camera app by clicking on index 13 were incorrect as it led to Google Lens. To proceed correctly, I will navigate back to the home screen and then attempt to open the Camera app directly from there or use another method to access the camera.

E0000 00:00:1753063767.394211  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long
Summary: Navigated back from Google Lens to the home screen to access the Camera app directly for taking a photo, as Google Lens was not suitable for this task.
Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "up"}
Reason: The user's goal is to take a photo, and the previous attempts to open the Camera app by clicking on the Google Lens icon (index 13) were incorrect. The Camera app icon is not visible on the current screen, so I will scroll the screen to reveal more apps, potentially including the Camera app.
E0000 00:00:1753063784.676779  847993 tcp_posix.cc:595] recvmsg encountered uncommon error: Message too long
Summary: Scrolled up to reveal more apps on the home screen, but the Camera app is still not visible. The action did not change the visible apps significantly, suggesting further navigation or a different approach might be needed to access the Camera app.
Completed step 5.
----------step 6

Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The Camera app is not visible on the current screen, and previous attempts to find it by scrolling up were unsuccessful. To ensure the Camera app is accessed to fulfill the user's goal of taking a photo, I will now attempt to scroll down to reveal more apps that might include the Camera app.
